Open source community, being socialist-minded, is known to react dismissively at cases of copyright infringement. FOSS people were going as far as calling me "asshole" for pointing these issues. I even got banned from opengameart.org, for bringing up the subject of OGA distributing stolen assets.

Here is a quote of typical open source advocate, regarding art theft:

    Going back and reading your post history tells me you're mentally handicapped
    and probably can't help how stupid you are... Also, it's not theft, the creators
    of the assets you're talking about still have the assets. Nothing was removed
    from their ownership, just copied.
                    -- gweny404 (https://www.reddit.com/user/gweny404)

And still I have collected a few facts of illegal appropriation of intellectual property by FOSS community.

Open source developers rarely check the source of the assets. For example, several open source games (like ZeroK-RTS) appear to be using sounds from http://free-loops.com/pd-loops-1.html which is  full of illegal content, like the sounds taken from Sound Ideas (http://free-loops.com/2975-9mm-shotgun.html), Godzilla movies (http://free-loops.com/3006-godzilla.html) or Warcraft 2 (http://free-loops.com/3010-horse.html http://free-loops.com/3009-hello.html).


- opengameart.org hosts a lot of non-free content. There are assets clearly derived or stolen from non-free shows, as well as art illegally re-licensed from non-free licenses.
    https://opengameart.org/content/sound-effects-from-monster-rpg-2 - steals sound from Sound Ideas 6000 Series; for example cartoon_fall.ogg can be found on CD10, track 83, "comedy. accent slide whistle down". Other user, "undesired", warned them, but they keep stealing. Same goes for Monster RPG2, for which these sounds were taken. AFAIK, that user "undesired" got banned for "trolling" due to reporting issues such as this one. Undesired even describes himself as "A "troll" who makes a "pointless" arena FPS game while pointing out copyright encumberances no one wants to believe" - that is how open source community treats people, by insulting them and their work.
    https://opengameart.org/content/nightstrike-png-assets (Spark.wav actually comes from Sound Ideas 6000 library - http://soundeffects.wikia.com/wiki/Sound_Ideas,_ELECTRICITY,_SPARK_-_HIGH_VOLTAGE_SPARK,_ELECTRICAL_12 - i.e. it cannot be licensed public domain)
    https://opengameart.org/content/amthomorphic-wishing-well (stolen clipart https://www.123rf.com/photo_11051019_isolated-illustration-of-an-ancient-and-magical-wishing-well.html)
    https://opengameart.org/content/cute-cat-spritesheet (stolen from https://www.123rf.com/photo_13708512_illustration-of-cute-cat-wearing-a-red-collar-with-gold-tag.html)
    https://opengameart.org/content/cute-dog-spritesheet (stolen from https://www.123rf.com/photo_8661585_cute-puppy.html or https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-images-cute-dog-image17899304)
    http://opengameart.org/content/game-art-from-ant-grab (no idea where stone texture come from but, salt flats texture was stolen from http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mud-cracks-on-salt-pan-northern-cape-high-res-stock-photography/475156577)
    http://opengameart.org/content/fbi-chic (Dana Scully character from X-Files)
    http://opengameart.org/content/balloons-and-balls without credit uses crown icon http://www.allvectors.com/crown-vector/ which is Creative Commons Attribution, so cant be used as public domain. Then we find that allvectors.com steals vectors from commercial sources: http://www.microstockgroup.com/image-sleuth/allvectors-com-free-(stolen)-vectors-for-download!/ so this crown vector is not free at all.

- Other content at GameArtOrg has potential license issues. For example, CC-BY sfx foom_0.wav ( https://opengameart.org/content/spell-4-fire ) was later re-uploaded by another user, who relicensed under public domain, as part of larger collection ( https://opengameart.org/content/huge-collection-of-retro-sound-effects-from-my-various-projects )


- Similar story with freesound.org. For example:
     https://freesound.org/people/Dipsyluvspo13/sounds/353441/ - even tags say "Sound Ideas Series 1000 General - Electricity 1011_35_1, All Sound Effects & Music are Copyright Sound Ideas - All Rights Reserved". So it obviously cannot be licensed into public domain.
     https://freesound.org/people/linnommt/sounds/376608/ - easily recognizable camel sound (also used in Hexen for Ettins and Centaurs), which actually comes from Sound Ideas Series 6000 General - CD3 - 38 - "camel low calls. animal". Works based on Sound Ideas assets cannot be released under CC-BY 3.0 license.


- Glest/MegaGlest steals sounds from Warcraft 2. For example, see https://www.sounds-resource.com/pc_computer/warcraft2/
  WARTPISD.wav - https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-data/blob/d1444655692f738552915fba55bf21424cdb8a7f/techs/megapack/commondata/sounds/pig_die4.wav
  Pig.wav - https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-data/blob/d1444655692f738552915fba55bf21424cdb8a7f/techs/megapack/commondata/sounds/pig_select4.wav

- Warzone 2010 steals sounds from Sound Ideas. For example https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/blob/master/data/base/audio/sfx/weapons/build2.ogg is a blatant copy of ELECTRICITY, SPARK 40 from Sound Ideas 6000 series: http://www.audiomicro.com/high-voltage-spark-electricity-royalty-free-stock-music-944993

- Advanced Strategic Command (http://www.asc-hq.org) steals sounds from Warcraft 2 and Command & Conquer. For example asc-2.6.1.0.tar.bz2\asc-2.6.1.0\data\sounds\burning.ogg is the same sound as the one heard in Warcraft 2 when player selects damaged building, while gateling.ogg and weapon06_s.ogg are the gun8.aud from C&C and gun13.aud from C&C Red Alert.

- Blades of Exile Source Release 3 (http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/blades/opensource.html) steals sounds from Sound Ideas Series 6000. For example, SND95.WAV is CD18 - 90 - "horror screech", while SND84.WAV is CD3 - 65 - "horse interior - whinny. animal".

- DungeonHack (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dungeonhack/files/0.10/) says that its "assets are licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3", yet it includes numerous non-free sfx files, such as grassland.ogg and grassland3.ogg, which have tags say "Sounddogs.com Preview", implying that they were stolen from site's preview player, without paying any money for them, and even if money were paid, such royalty free assets cannot be released under GPLv3 license. Other assets are of similarly dubious origins, as say MonsterRoar.wav is a very recognizable sfx, that comes from Sound Ideas Series 6000 General - CD3 - 37 - "bobcat growl. animal".

- OpenLieroX (https://github.com/albertz/openlierox/tree/0.59/share/gamedir): communism allows them to "borrow" assets from Naruto, Doom and WH40k, then re-release these assets under GPL

- Gnome steals assets from Apple OSX, Microsoft Windows, Super Mario and Metal Gear Solid:
  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Mavericks?content=174324
  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Windows+7+sound+scheme+?content=158018
  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Windows+8+sounds?content=164828
  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Super+Mario+bros?content=141676
  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Metal_Gear_Solid_v.1?content=156964

- Wesnoth: wanderer.ogg is a variation on Betrayal at Krondor main theme

- Pingus: data/images/special/pacman -- graphics from Namco's game

- Fish Fillets: soundtrack from X-Files (TV series). Graphics and sounds from Warcraft 2.

- Stendhal: steals sounds from warcraft 2 (arrow-1.ogg) and half of its graphics comes from enterbrain's RPGMaker (for example, sandy_rocks.png, oak_tree.png, maple_tree.png, locust_tree.png, pine_tree.png, snow_on_pine.png, ship.png, object/ship.png, tan_tent.png). Also pacman.png. Most of the sound files were stolen from commercial sound archives. For example, horse-1 sound comes from Sound Ideas 6000, CD3, track 65 "horse interior - whinny. animal".

- Crossfire is known to infringe on sprites from Starcraft (archon sprite) and Dark Legions (demon, greater demon, likely found at http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/demons/index.htm) and Final Fantasy VI (giant worm - http://crossfire.real-time.com/spoiler/monsters/monsters_e_to_h.html). Bear comes from (http://www.galaraf.net/ANIGIFS/bears/index.htm) and rat (http://www.animatedimages.org/img-animated-rat-image-0011-111229.htm) come from some non-free sources too.

- Daimonin: used beholder and a few other sprites from SSI Gold Box games

- Egoboo: Most of Egoboo's sound samples are stolen I.e. from Baldur's Gate (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/master/basicdat/stealth.ogg), from the soundtrack to Indiana Jones movie (https://github.com/egoboo/egoboo-assets/blob/master/modules/archaeologist.mod/objects/bouldertrap.obj/sound2.wav). A lot of others Egoboo sounds appear to be coming from Sound Ideas: i.e. abyss.mod has sound0.wav and sound4.wav, which also appears in several other games, such as Might & Magic 6 (gold03.wav)  

- S.C.O.U.R.G.E. (https://sourceforge.net/projects/scourge/): 3d models based of movies (i.e. Alien, Blade, etc..) and games like Id Software's Doom 

- Runesword 2: later releases infringe on graphics from Age of empires and Majesty. The original release still uses sounds from Sound Ideas, such as the afore mentioned bobcat sfx.

- 8 Kingdoms (https://sourceforge.net/projects/kralovstvi/): sounds from Warcraft 2

- TripleA (https://sourceforge.net/projects/triplea/): graphics stolen from other games (i.e. cursor_gauntlet.gif comes from World of Warcraft) Sounds apprantly come from non-free sources and music is stolen from various movies (i.e. game_start_01_start_of_lotr_company_of_the_ring.wav comes from Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi)

- LGeneral-data (https://gitlab.com/lgeneral-data/lgeneral-data): explosion.wav is based of http://www.freesound.org/people/ERH/sounds/33181/ and http://www.freesound.org/people/HerbertBoland/sounds/33637/ which are non-free.
