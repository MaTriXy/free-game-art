Open source community, being socialist-minded, is known to react dismissively at cases of copyright infringement. FOSS people were going as far as calling me "asshole" for pointing these issues. I even got banned from opengameart.org, for bringing up the subject of OGA distributing stolen assets.

Here is a quote of typical open source advocate, regarding art theft:

    Going back and reading your post history tells me you're mentally handicapped
    and probably can't help how stupid you are... Also, it's not theft, the creators
    of the assets you're talking about still have the assets. Nothing was removed
    from their ownership, just copied.
                    -- gweny404 (https://www.reddit.com/user/gweny404)

And still I have collected a few facts of illegal appropriation of intellectual property by FOSS community.

Open source developers rarely check the source of the assets. For example, several open source games (like ZeroK-RTS) appear to be using sounds from http://free-loops.com/pd-loops-1.html which is  full of illegal content, like the sounds taken from Sound Ideas (http://free-loops.com/2975-9mm-shotgun.html), Godzilla movies (http://free-loops.com/3006-godzilla.html) or Warcraft 2 (http://free-loops.com/3010-horse.html http://free-loops.com/3009-hello.html).


- opengameart.org hosts a lot of non-free content. There are assets clearly derived or stolen from non-free shows, as well as art re-licensed from non-free licenses.

    http://opengameart.org/content/game-art-from-ant-grab (no idea where stone texture come from but, salt flats texture was stolen from http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/mud-cracks-on-salt-pan-northern-cape-high-res-stock-photography/475156577)
    http://opengameart.org/content/fbi-chic (Dana Scully character from X-Files)
    http://opengameart.org/content/balloons-and-balls without credit uses crown icon http://www.allvectors.com/crown-vector/ which is Creative Commons Attribution, so cant be used as public domain. Then we find that allvectors.com steals vectors from commercial sources: http://www.microstockgroup.com/image-sleuth/allvectors-com-free-(stolen)-vectors-for-download!/ so this crown vector is not free at all.

Similar story with freesound.org. For example:
     https://freesound.org/people/Dipsyluvspo13/sounds/353441/ - even tags say "Sound Ideas Series 1000 General - Electricity 1011_35_1, All Sound Effects & Music are Copyright Sound Ideas - All Rights Reserved". So it obviously cannot be licensed into public domain.


- Advanced Strategic Command (http://www.asc-hq.org) steals sounds from Warcraft 2 and Command & Conquer. For example asc-2.6.1.0.tar.bz2\asc-2.6.1.0\data\sounds\burning.ogg is the same sound as the one heard in Warcraft 2 when player selects damaged building, while gateling.ogg and weapon06_s.ogg are the gun8.aud from C&C and gun13.aud from C&C Red Alert.
